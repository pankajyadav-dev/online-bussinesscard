   ```

5. Configure email settings:
   Edit `includes/functions.php` and update the SMTP settings in the `sendEmail()` function:
   ```php
   $mail->Host       = 'smtp.gmail.com';          // SMTP server
   $mail->Username   = 'your-email@gmail.com';    // SMTP username
   $mail->Password   = 'your-password';           // SMTP password
   $mail->setFrom('your-email@gmail.com', 'Business Card Creator');
   ```

6. Set up the web server:
